# Signum Harbor Challenge

List of classes/tests and UML for Challenge #1

![UML Diagram](./UML.png)

Even though the project requirements were relatively straightforward and only a UML diagram was requested, I chose to create a full code base along with a few unit tests. These tests demonstrate my approach to testing applications with **BDD-style naming** for classes and methods.

In addition, I provided an example of using **XUnit** combined with **Autofixture** and **Automock** customization, along with **FluentAssertions**. This combination is especially highlighted in the `Skipper` tests.

The UML diagram was created in **Lucidchart**, my preferred tool for UML diagrams and similar visual needs.
